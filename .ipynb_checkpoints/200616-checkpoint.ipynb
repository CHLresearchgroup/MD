    "This notebook will take you through the workflow I used for running MD jobs and analysing the results. This workflow applies to:\n",
    "- MD run of any length\n",
    "- MD runs with custom residues (forcefields developed in CGenFF tutorial)\n",
    "- MD runs with multiple protein chains\n",
    "- MD runs with multiple replicates (that are analyzed together)\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is not meant for more complicated MD jobs such as those using advanced sampling techniques like REMD\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDB file used in this is from an E. coli ACP/FabA complex. It includes 4 distinct protein chains, a cyanylated Ppant arm in a custom residue called PCN, and Histidine residues that need to be in specific protonation states\n",

    "## File names\n",
    "The following is my suggestion for naming and organizing files when working with MD simulations. It is not necessary for you to follow this naming/organizational structure when running your own jobs, but I do suggest it. However, If you have a system that works better for you , please ignore my suggestion completely 😁.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the large number of files created I think it is extremely important to stay organized. I have spent a lot of time trying to go back and figure out exactly what files are, where I put files, and what I did in a directory. To prevent you from doing the same, I would suggest following basic lab notebook practices with your computational records:\n",
    "- when you start a new \"experiment\", put it in a new directory and give it a name/number, just like starting a new lab notebook page\n",
    "    - I like to name directories after the date that they were created, when I run through this tutorial, I will rename it 200616 for june 16, 2020\n",
    "- treat files in the directory like samples in the lab and name them accordingly\n",
    "    - it is common for MD files from different runs to have the same name\n",
    "    - It is also common to move files through directories, if you make a mistake and put a file into the wrong directory, you want it to be easy to figure out       where the file belongs\n",
    "    - I accomplish this by putting the directory name in front of files in that directory\n",
    "        - ex: 200616_md.mdp\n",
    "- Keep a \"table of contents\" in a README file. I used a README.ipynb jupyter notebook which allowed me to easily format a table\n",
    "    - include paths to each directory\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "I will follow this system in the tutorial. After you clone the repository to your WS account, change the name of the directory and the name of the files in it. Then run the following cell to edit the commands in the rest of the notebook"

    "### Removing Periodicity in the trajectory\n",
    "As you may have seen, the protein will sometimes drift across the boundary of the box during the simulation. If left alone, the protein will appear to be broken in the eyes of certain analysis methods. For example, if you run a RMSD calculation on the trajectory of a protein that crosses its periodic boundary, you will see a massive RMSD value. Because the protein corsses the boundary and appears on the other side of the box, the distance between atoms on the boundary goes from a couple angstroms to the entire width of the box, producing a huge RMSD. To fix this, we will run a series of trj_conv commands. The two  that I include here will work for me in this case, but if you notice, by looking at analysis plots or a movie of the trajectory, that the protein is still not centered throughout the trajectory, try running different trj_conv commands until the protein is centered. \n"
